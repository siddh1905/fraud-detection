# fraud-detection
 Fraud Detection System is a project focused on identifying suspicious or unauthorized financial transactions using a combination of rule-based methods, machine learning models, and behavioral analysis. The goal is to help banks, digital wallets, and financial platforms detect fraud early, reduce losses, and ensure secure transactions.

## 📖 About The Project
Fraud detection is complex, involving AI, machine learning, and behavioral biometrics. This project translates those technical concepts into an **interactive web experience**. 
Instead of reading a boring PDF, users can explore data visualizations, walk through the detection pipeline step-by-step, and even play the role of a bank analyst to spot fraud in a gamified simulator.

## ✨ Key Features
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Visualizes attack vectors and risk factors using dynamic charts (Chart.js).
* **The Detection Pipeline:** A clickable, step-by-step breakdown of how a transaction is processed in milliseconds.
* **Analyst Simulator:** A mini-game where users judge real-time transactions based on risk signals (IP, velocity, device).
* **Comparison Engine:** Visualizes the difference between legacy "Rules-based" systems and modern "AI" detection.
* **Downloadable:** Users can save the entire report as a PDF or HTML file for offline use.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Core:** HTML5, Vanilla JavaScript (No heavy frameworks).
* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via CDN) for a responsive, modern layout.
* **Visualization:** Chart.js for rendering performance and radar/doughnut charts.
* **Architecture:** Single Page Application (SPA) contained within one file.
